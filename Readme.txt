Cryptexcel is a Windows desktop application developed in c language (with a VBscript). Principal functions of this project are :
- Encrypt excel database
- Generate a key file
- Decrypt the Encrypted file using the Key

as you might know c is not familiare with exel files so i used some VBscripts to convert excel files xlsx/xls into csv and vice versa.
